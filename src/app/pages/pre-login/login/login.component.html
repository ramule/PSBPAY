                                <p class="m-text mt-3"><b>Shoulder surfing and Prevention</b></p>
                                <p class="m-text">Shoulder surfing is a technique wherein someone looks over you shoulder, to get information about what you are writing or typing. Shoulder surfing is an effective way to get information in crowded places, such as cyber caffe,
                                    because it's relatively easy to stand next to someone and watch as they fill out a form, enter e-Banking User ID and Password, or enter a PIN number at an ATM machine. Shoulder surfing can also be done long distance with the aid of binoculars or other vision-enhancing devices.</p>
                                <p class="m-text mt-3"><b>To prevent shoulder surfing</b></p>
                                <p class="m-text">It is recommended that you shield paperwork or your keyboard from view by using your body or cupping your hand. So watch out around you before you use e-Banking from crowded place.</p>

                                <p class="m-text mt-3">Cyber criminals use Phishing scams to set up convincing spoofs of legitimate Web sites. They then try to trick users into visiting these Web sites and disclosing personal information, such as your Passwords, ATM Pin etc. <br/><br/>
                                    Cyber criminals use Web addresses that resemble the name of a well-known company but are slightly altered by adding, omitting, or transposing letters. For example, the address "www.microsoft.com" could appear instead as:

                                    This is called "typo-squatting" or "cybersquatting." <br/>
                                    Typo-squatters and cybersquatters can also create more insidious scams, such as downloading malicious software applications and spyware onto unprotected computers that connect to their sites.<br/><br/>
                                    So look closely the URL in the address field of your browser when you do online banking or online shopping.

                                            People become 'money mules' by answering vaguely worded classified ads offering opportunity to work flexible hours from home as, say, a bookkeeper or funds-transfer agent. They are instructed to open a bank account to handle transactions for the supposed employer, into which the stolen money is deposited, and then to wire it to an overseas account from a commercial wire service such as Western Union.<br/><br/>
                                            The hackers generally keep transactions under some amount because a withdrawal of that amount or higher requires the bank to file a currency transaction report to RBI.

                                            How many times have you gotten an e-mail from someone you don't know, has your name on it and looks enticing enough to open it? Just clicking on a link within that particular e-mail can get you in trouble. If the sender is not who they portray themselves to be, then someone is Phishing. With you as the fish, and the e-mail as the bait. For example, you get an e-mail from your Bank asking you to provide your User ID and Password because Bank is doing some sort of enhancements in their computer system and alike.
                                             The content of the e-mail will have a sense of urgency that if you don't provide the details your online Banking account will be de-activated. Keep this in mind:<br/><br/>
                                            "Legitimate businesses don't ever ask you for personal information in an e-mail. It's as simple as that."<br/><br/>
                                            The best practice is to never click on a link in an e-mail. If you really want to know what's up, then go and type the exact address of the link in the address bar of your browser and see what's up. If there is nothing there, you know somebody has been Phishing.

                                            Read everything! If you go to install a program, don't believe if it's been recommended as a safe program by anyone, read the "fine print" that comes before you start installing. There is a EULA (End User License Agreement) at the beginning of any programs installation. Read it! Most are fine, but others have what is called bundled software. See this installation image:

Maintain privacy of your personal financial information such as- ATM card number, ATM Pin, Credit card number, CVV number, Internet Banking User ID, & Password, and so on. Ensure nobody gets these details when you shop, eat in a restaurant, operating your account in a cyber cafe, and any such public places. Secure these details as you secure your wallet in busy market.

                                            A secure password is one that can't be guessed. For example, if your name is Amit Kumar then Amit1234, kumar1234, amit999, kumar888, or alike are not good passwords. Hackers have amazing password cracking capabilities, so the longer and more jumbled the password, the better. And don't use the same password for each account because if they get one account, they get them all.
